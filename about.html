          The Mighty ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
          athletes residing Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to
          learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the
          ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran
          by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time
          of parents and previous league members.
