          <ol>
            <li>DIMENSIONS.IHF</li>
            <p>
              Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a
              given maximum width and length. these dimensions should be adhered
              to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
            </p>
            <li>COMPETITION FIELDS.</li>
            <p>
              Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of
              100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or association participating in
              the state competition program that are unable to provide a field
              that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
              Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
              inspect the field and recommend to the board whether or not a
              waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. teams from
              league, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
              acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
            </p>
            <li>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</li>
            <ol>

                U-6 play on a field approximately 20 x 40 yards with no penalty
                areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively
                larger.
              </li>
              <li>
                U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width

                internal dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.
